# Minishell

## üìò Description

Minishell is a simplified shell implementation written in C. It aims to replicate a subset of the behavior of common UNIX shells (like bash), while deepening the understanding of process management, parsing, and signal handling at the system level.

This project is part of the 42 curriculum, and this implementation includes **only the mandatory part**, following the subject's requirements strictly.

## ‚úÖ Mandatory Features

- Display a prompt and wait for user input
- Handle command lines and execute programs using `PATH` environment variable
- Builtin commands:
  - `echo` with option `-n`
  - `cd` with only a relative or absolute path
  - `pwd` with no options
  - `export` with no options
  - `unset` with no options
  - `env` with no options or arguments
  - `exit` with no options
- Redirections:
  - `<`, `>`
  - `<<` (heredoc)
  - `>>`
- Pipes: `|` (multiple pipes supported)
- Environment variable expansion (`$VAR`)
- Handle quotes (`'` and `"`) properly
- Signal handling (`ctrl+C`, `ctrl+\`, `ctrl+D`)
- Exit status (`$?`) support

## üß† What I Learned

- Lexical analysis and parsing user input
- Implementing a custom tokenizer for shell commands
- File descriptor manipulation and redirection logic
- Process creation with `fork()`, `execve()`, and `waitpid()`
- Managing signal handlers using `signal()` and `sigaction()`
- Building a minimal garbage collector for memory management
- Handling edge cases like quoting, escaping, and invalid input
